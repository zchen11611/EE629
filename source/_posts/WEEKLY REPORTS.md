## WEEKLY REPORTS

### Week 13-15:

- continue on my final project: Select retake and repeat steps 5-9, select upload to recall the image data
- make the data clean
- Updated my blob site by adding this week report, and fixing the bugs of the final project.
- Committed the changes to GitHub

### Week 12:

- Uploded the code on GitHub, and updated the GitHub link accordingly

- Collect the data collection of image and install the SDK 

- Attended the online lecture and study Lesson10:

  -  Python programming is a common thread through IoT native services, web services, data analysis, and system management
  - IoT communication models
    - Request-response — Django REST framework, Flask, *etc*.
    - Publish-subscribe — Crossbar.io, Paho, *etc*.
  - IoT cloud platforms — ThingSpeak, Particle Cloud, *etc*.

  

### Week 11:

- Watched the recording of lesson's 9 lecture. Plus, I read and studied lesson 9 slides and lab.
- About Lesson9:
  - NETCONF protocol and YANG data modeling language provide advanced capabilities of automating IoT system configuration and management
  - Pyang validates and converts YANG modules to various formats such as YIN
  - Netopeer is a set of NETCONF tools built on the Libnetconf library
  - Ncclient is a Python library that facilitates client-side scripting and application development around the NETCONF protocol
  - Cloud native computing, service mesh, and blockchain drive continuous innovation in IoT systems and services
- Choose a title for my project 

### Week 10:

- Watched the recording of lesson's 8 lecture and I studied lesson 8 slides and lab.

### Week 9:

- Watched the recording of lesson's 7 lecture and I studied lesson 7 slides and lab
- Reviewed the content of the slide.
- About lesson7:
  - Several PaaS providers offer cloud storage and analytics
  - Google Sheets Requires OAuth 2.0 credentials in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and in the same directory as the Python code to open the spreadsheet and append rows
- Reviewed the material from Github and started doing Lab6

### Week 8:

- Watched the recording of lesson's 6 lecture and I studied lesson 6 slides and lab
- I reviewed Python 2 and 3 
- About lesson6: Alternative Devices
  - A number of IoT development boards support Ethernet, USB development interface, or Linux OS,
  - Form factors vary from 36mm x 20mm to 127mm x 79mm
  - Some include Wi-Fi — few support enterprise Wi-Fi
  - Some have eMMC memory on board
  - Those without HDMI rely on USB development interface

### Week 6-7:

- Watched the recording of lesson's 5 lecture and I studied lesson 5 slides and lab
- review the report of other students

### Week 5:

- I studied Lesson 4 materials and lab, and implemented what I learned about Flask on another cource to present the data on a web page. 

### Week 4:

- Watched the recording of lesson's 3 lecture and I studied lesson 3 slides and lab
- About the Lesson3: Python
  - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language
    - Data structure, flow control, functions, modules, classes, files, date, time, coordinates, and send email
  - Anaconda
  - To speed up execution, Python interpreter automatically converts source code (.py) once to byte code (.pyc) with the same file name in the same directory 
  - Use IDE or text editor to create and edit source code
  - Run secure copy (scp) on laptop to transfer files to and from  Raspberry Pi
- I started doing lab3. I found my Raspberry Pi could use the Python 2.7.16 which had been downloaded in my laptop automatically. 

### Week 3:

- Reviewed the content of the slide. I spent several days to learn Python
- About the lesson2L: Raspberry Pi 
  - The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse
  - An SD card inserted into the slot on the board acts as the hard drive for the Raspberry Pi. It is powered by USB and the video output can be hooked up to a traditional RCA TV set, a more modern monitor, or even a TV using the HDMI port
  - Two commonly encountered problems with Raspberry Pi
  - Raspberry Pi serial has two mutually exclusive uses
  - Always double-check GPIO numbering and wiring to avoid damaging Raspberry Pi

### Week 1-2:

- Watched the recording of lesson's  lecture and I studied lesson slides(Lesson0-1)
- I made the GitHub repository for 629 and prepared the basic knowledge framework like Python
- I finished Lab1and installed Raspberry Pi on VMware Workstation 15. The operating system is Debian 7.x. Then I made some changes in Raspberry Pi Configuration.
- During Lab02, I learned how to use virtual Raspberry Pi to run circuit, since I used the virtual machine to run Raspberry Pi.
