Hi, I'm Zhi Chen. 

This webpage I will share my weekly reports, course project and any other contributions. All can be accessed using the top navigation menu:

The weekly reports page will be about my weekly work on the Internet of Things course (EE-629) and I will record the content of my weekly study.

The GitHub page will have a link to access my repository.

My project will be an ios demo based on swift called Face recognition_live detection. 



Labs: could not get my hand on a Raspberry Pi, therefore, I tried to study it manually which helped me understand how to handle it, and hopefully, in coming days I will buy one as I have plans to implement some ideas with it.

Project: can be found on Project page with the code.
