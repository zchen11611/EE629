In this page I will share my weekly reports, course project and any other contributions. All can be accessed using the top navigation menu:

The weekly reports page will be about my weekly work on the Internet of Things course (EE-629).

The GitHub page will have a link to access my repository.

My project will be a Python program called Distance Measurement and Weather Information. The program will ask the user for his location and the location that he want to go to. Then, it will calculate the distance between the two points using an API. Additionally, it will pull the weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API for both addresses.

The program will measure the distance in miles between two addresses entered by the user. Also, will provide a weather information of the addresses.

Will use the US Census geocoding API to measure the distance. The API will take an address and return an actual or calculated latitude/longitude coordinate.

The program will need the user to enter the address with:

Structure number and street name (required)

City name (optional)

State (optional)

ZIP code (optional)

the OpenWeatherMap API well retrieve the current temperature of both addresses in Celsius.

The returned values of both API will be in json.

Attendance: I am glad that I attended all lectures in this semester whither with section A or W9.

Weekly Reports: can be found on the Weekly Reports page.

Labs: could not get my hand on a Raspberry Pi, therefore, I tried to study it manually which helped me understand how to handle it, and hopefully, in coming days I will buy one as I have plans to implement some ideas with it.

Contributions: hopefully, my Python program will help any developer that wants a function to calculate the distance between two addresses and the current temperature of them. Also, I am proud that I have a badge as an Arctic Code Vault Contributor on GitHub.

Project: can be found on Project page with the results of it.
